//^4.19.2

//last part 2 :: Denotes some minor changes (e.g dependency update, typos), no new functionality
//middle part 19 ::  recommended bug fixes (security updates), add new functionality but in backward-compatible manner
//first part 4 :: Major release, breaking update (when there are incompatible changes introduced in the 
//                software. These are significant changes that may break backward compatibility or 
//                introduce entirely new functionality.)  


//^ --> it fixes 4
//  --> other minor and bug fix part can change

//~ --> fixes major part and bug fix part
//  --> minor part can change

// We can fix the version by without using such symbol

// We can use ranges >=4.19.2 <5.0.0
// We can also use or <4.0.0 || >= 4.1.1 <4.2.3 || more ranges
// We can use x to denote flexibility of part :: 4.x.x
// * -> Matches every version  //Not a good practice
// 1.0.0 - 2.0.0
